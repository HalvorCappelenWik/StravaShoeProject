## The idea behind this tradingbot is to buy and hold SPY (the ETF tracking the S&P500 idex)
## The position will be closed as soon as I loose more than 10% or recieves a profit greater than 10%
## After this the bot will stop investing for a pre determined period of time. 
## When the time has passed, the cycle starts again.
